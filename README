Description:
  This script is run on a server (slave) with a non-static IP address. It will periodically check the IP address and, if it has changed, will connect to the server (master) that maintains a record of the slave's IP via SSH and update the /etc/hosts file with the slave's IP and hostname.

Definitions:
  Master: A server that contains the slave's IP address in its /etc/hosts file (for easy use in Apache proxies, etc). The master has a static IP address.
  Slave: The slave has a non-static IP address and uses this script for updating it in the /etc/hosts file of the master.

Instructions:
  1) Place the public key of the slave into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys folder for the master's root user (unless some other user can edit /etc/hosts)
  2) Remove any existing mentions of the slave from your master hosts file.
  3) Open the config file and enter a host or ip address for master. Leave slave blank!
  4) Run the script for the first time. It will add your slave's current IP to the master's hosts file in a proper format. The script will maintain this by checking if it has changed every 15 minutes using whatismyip.com's API. 
  NOTE: I designed it to support multiple independent slaves on one master, but I haven't tested that.
  
Usage:
  The script is super simple and takes no arguments, you run it like so:
  ./ipchanged.rb
  To set up your system to check and update periodically, set it up to run with cron, which would use a command like this:
  */15 * * * * su - yourusername -c "/path/to/ipchanged.rb"
  
Disclaimer:
  This script edits /etc/hosts file as root! Use with caution. I'm not responsible if something bad happens!
